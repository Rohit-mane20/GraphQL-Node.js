### Dependencies Breakdown:
- **Apollo Client** and **React-related libraries** (`react`, `react-apollo`, `react-dom`, etc.) are not typically required for a backend-focused GraphQL project.
- **Webpack**, **babel-core**, and other frontend-related packages are unnecessary if you're just learning the GraphQL API with Node.js.
- **Express-GraphQL** is a backend GraphQL implementation and is an alternative to **Apollo Server**, but if you're learning GraphQL with Apollo, you should use **Apollo Server** instead.
- **Passport** and **passport-local** are used for authentication, but unless you're working on user authentication, these can be removed.

# GraphQL with Node.js - Learning Project

This is a project where I am exploring and learning GraphQL concepts using Node.js. The goal of this project is to build a simple backend API using GraphQL to better understand how GraphQL works, and how it can be integrated with Node.js to create dynamic and flexible data queries.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs and runtime for executing those queries
- **Apollo Server**: A powerful GraphQL server integrated with Express for handling queries and mutations
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables (e.g., port, database credentials)
- **mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js (if database integration is used)
- **nodemon**: For automatic server restarts during development (optional but helpful)

## Features
- Basic setup of a Node.js server with GraphQL integration
- Creation of GraphQL schema, types, and resolvers
- Queries and mutations for manipulating data
- Simple CRUD operations with GraphQL
- Integrated with **Apollo Server** for handling GraphQL queries and mutations

## Project Structure
- **src**: Contains all the source code, including schema definitions, resolvers, and server setup.
- **config**: Stores configuration files (e.g., environment variables).
- **server.js**: The entry point for the Node.js server.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Rohit-mane20/GraphQL-Node.js.git`
   
2. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`

3. Start the server:  
   `npm start`

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to access the GraphQL playground and start testing queries and mutations.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the core concepts of GraphQL, such as schemas, queries, mutations, and resolvers.
- Learn how to set up a GraphQL server with Node.js and Apollo Server.
- Practice building flexible and efficient APIs using GraphQL.
- Explore the benefits of using GraphQL over REST APIs in real-world applications.
